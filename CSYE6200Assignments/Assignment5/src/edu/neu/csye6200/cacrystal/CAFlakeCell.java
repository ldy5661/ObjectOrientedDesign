    Snowflakes are formed when water vapor in a cloud freezes into ice, and that the 
    structure of a given snowflake is determined by the temperature and humidity of
    the environment in which it grows, and the length of itme it spends there. Whenever 
    a piece of ice is added to the snowflake, there is some heat released, which then 
    tends to inhibit the addition of further pieces of ice nearby.When water or water vapor 
    freezes into ice, it releases a certain amount of latent heat as the reverse of the 
    phenomenon that when ice is warmed to 0 ÂºC it still needs heat applied before it will actually melt.
